# Multi-valued_MP_AHP_Method

**This program computes the multi-valued morphological profile using the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) vector ordering algorithm.**

## The method

The pixel-vectors covered by the structuring element are treated as the *alternatives* of a multi-criteria decision problem, and the image bands as its *criteria*. For each band, AHP builds a pairwise comparison matrix between all the pixel-vectors of the neighborhood. Instead of Saaty's subjective 1-9 scale, an objective preference function proportional to the radiometric difference is used: P(a_i, a_j) = 1 + (g(a_i) - g(a_j)) if g(a_i) >= g(a_j), and 1 / (1 + (g(a_j) - g(a_i))) otherwise.

Each matrix is normalized by its column sums, the local priority of each pixel-vector is the mean of its row, and the global priority S(a_i) is the weighted sum of the local priorities using the band weights. A single preference function is used: the **supremum** (dilation) is the pixel-vector with the highest global priority and the **infimum** (erosion) the one with the lowest. Ties are broken deterministically so that both extrema are always unique.

The supremum and infimum obtained in every neighborhood are used to compute, for each size of the structuring element: erosion, dilation, opening, closing, opening by reconstruction and closing by reconstruction (multivariate morphological profile).

## Implementation

- **Language:** C# (WPF desktop application with a graphical interface)
- **Framework:** .NET 10 (`net10.0-windows`)
- **Development environment:** Visual Studio Code with the *C# Dev Kit* extension
- **Operating system:** Windows 64-bit (WPF is Windows-only)
- **Structuring element:** disk; the disk of size i is obtained by i successive applications of the elementary disk of radius 1 (5 pixels). Border pixels whose neighborhood falls outside the image are kept unchanged.
- **Interface language:** French

## How to run

### Option 1 — Standalone executable (no installation)

Download `EMP_AHP_UniquePreferenceFunction.exe` from the **Releases** page of this repository, if available, and double-click it. It is self-contained: neither .NET nor VS Code is required. You can also build it yourself with Option 3.

### Option 2 — Visual Studio Code

1. Install the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and the **C# Dev Kit** extension for VS Code.
2. Clone or download this repository, then in VS Code: *File > Open Folder* and select the repository folder.
3. Press **F5** to build and run the program.

### Option 3 — Command line

```powershell
dotnet build "EMP_AHP_UniquePreferenceFunction\EMP_AHP_UniquePreferenceFunction.csproj"
dotnet run --project "EMP_AHP_UniquePreferenceFunction\EMP_AHP_UniquePreferenceFunction.csproj"

# Create the standalone executable in the Executable\ folder
dotnet publish "EMP_AHP_UniquePreferenceFunction\EMP_AHP_UniquePreferenceFunction.csproj" -c Release -o Executable
```

## Input parameters

| Field in the interface (French) | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *Donnez la taille maximale de l'ES : i =* | Maximum size of the disk-shaped structuring element. The program computes all sizes from 1 to i. |
| *Selection bande — Parcourir* | Select the image bands (one grayscale image per band, PNG/JPEG/BMP/TIFF, all of the same size). Multiple selection is allowed. |
| *Donnez le nombre d'itérations pour la stabilité* | Maximum number of iterations of the geodesic reconstruction (`0` = unlimited, run until stability). |
| *Donnez le pourcentage de ressemblance (0 - 100)* | Stability threshold: the reconstruction stops when two successive images are identical on at least this percentage of pixels (e.g. `35`). |
| *Donnez les poids des différentes bandes* | Band weights, separated by semicolons, no spaces (e.g. `0,45;0,35;0,20`). One weight per band. |

Then click **Executer**.

## Outputs

All results are written to the **`IMAGES-résultat`** folder, created next to the solution (`.sln`) file, or next to the executable if it is run alone:

- one TIFF image per band and per structuring-element size for each operator: `Erod`, `Dilat`, `OuvertureStandard`, `FermetureStandard`, `OuvertReconstruction`, `FermeReconstruction` (named `<operator> B_<band> ES_<size>.tiff`);
- three multiband images in **ENVI** format (`.img` + `.hdr`):
  - `OuvertReconstruction-multibande`: all openings by reconstruction;
  - `FermeReconstruction-multibande`: all closings by reconstruction;
  - `EXTENDED-PROFIL-MOR-multibande`: the extended morphological profile (openings and closings by reconstruction together).

## Multivariate Mathematical Morphology through Vector Ordering

The code published in this repository implements new algorithms that extend mathematical morphology operators to multivalued images, particularly multispectral satellite images. These approaches also apply to RGB color images.

This extension relies on vector-ordering strategies applied to the pixel-vectors within the neighborhood defined by a structuring element (SE). For each neighborhood, the ordering uniquely identifies the infimum and supremum pixel-vectors required by the fundamental erosion and dilation operations.

The proposed strategies are based on:

- The comparative structure of multi-criteria decision analysis methods: AHP, PROMETHEE (usual, U-shape, level and Gaussian preference functions), QUALIFLEX and TOPSIS (p = 1 and p = 2);
- Numeral-system-based methods;
- Outranking relations between pixel-vectors;
- Cumulative distances: SID (Spectral Information Divergence) and SAD (Spectral Angle Distance);
- The conventional lexicographic order.

Each program computes multivariate erosion, dilation, opening, closing, opening by reconstruction and closing by reconstruction, using a disk-shaped structuring element of increasing size. It also exports the extended morphological profile in ENVI format.
